[See a demo](http://pdincubus.github.io/Accessible-Horse-Tornado/)

##TODO

* Full cross-browser testing (Latest versions of Firefox, Edge, IE11, Safari 9, mobile Safari 9, Android latest. So far tested in Chrome only).
* Check with OSX and iOS VoiceOver, NVDA, anything other screen reader I can get my hands on
* Make a vanilla Javascript version remove jQuery dependency?

##Prerequisites to build the thing

* Gulp
* NPM
* Node

* Gulp runs the default task to create a dist/ straight away and then will sit running `watch`
